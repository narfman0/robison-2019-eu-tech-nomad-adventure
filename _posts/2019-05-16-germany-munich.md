We must be running out of energy. I have one set of pictures to submit for two entire
weeks in Munich. It's a great place, one of our current top 2 (with London). We've
extra enjoyed the biergartens and I suppose you can only take one picture of that.

Either way:

Train ride! We had a glorious ride. THrough Austria, there were some magical highways
and settlements perched up on layers of mountains intangigly hanging in the sky from which
huamnity plucks. They were interesting sites after the streets of Italy.

Hirschgarden! What a great place. They had huge amounts of seating, and reindeer were
just of to the left of this shot. Great beer, good bavarian fare, and a happy evening.

THis street performener was dangerously good. I bet he'll retire early
with how much money we collectively showered upon him.

Deceptively amazing Munich picture. Note how everyone is doing the right thing:
pedestrians right, bikes left, everyone travels on the right side, pass on the
left. Each bike is perfectly occupying one space, and it is perfectly set in
that space. There is no graffiti. There are no obstructions. There is no
extranneous garbage. There is just functionality, a method, and a process to be
followed.
