We are seeing a theme: we entered another unique and distinct sector of the EU
in Amsterdam. Our town of Vinkeveen is outside of Amsterdam ~25 minutes, and is
a mostly man made swt of islands. We walk ten minutes to a road, from which we can drive/bike.
Bikes are first class citizens, so car scum need to look out, especially in central.
