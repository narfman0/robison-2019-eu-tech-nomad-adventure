We started the day wanting to see big ben, westminster cathedral, and some history-y things, but
the million+ person protest overwhelmed the day and we decided to revel in it and ask around.

There was a large police presence and no violence. Everyone seemed to carry out the protest in peace.

I wish I grabbed video of this. We found a very small contingent (30 people) of pro-brexit
supporters. They were mostly older. Many of them carried Trump signs "Make America Great Again"
and signs claiming the people already voted. They had on funky music, which is the primary bit
I wish I captured. Now, after the fact, I liken it to yakkety sax on constant repeat. Many were
interestingly wearing yellow vests. The woman on the left is a yellow vester, note the red sign
which I believe is a MAGA sign (or at least looks just like what many of them were holding).
