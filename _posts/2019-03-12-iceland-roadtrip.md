We enjoyed some perfect temperature hot springs. The above body of water would erupt some 5' high,
with temperatures of 100 degrees celcius:

We came back to (truly) native Iceland experience of a popular ice cream shop:

Caught some glimpses of northern lights by a lighthouse in Reykjavik outskirts. With boring eyes,
they looked a bit white, thankfully we had robot eyes to capture a wonderful green hue. No filters added,
pixel 2 night mode shots:
