Several places in Florence, starting in the central open piazza.

There was a convenient exhibit outside of a museum with several notable reproductions

One day we wandered to a park, and stumbled upon an open air market. It ran parallel to
a river. Down a small hill was a road. Parallel and down still further was a smaller path
by the river, which unsurprisingly the adventurous children wanted to conquer.

From the museum, we could look down on a superior view of the street

Laocoon also representing. This was a special surprise for us since 1. we didn't know this
was in Florence and 2. is something we bonded over when we first met. After this Florence
could officially do no wrong.

After mommy sprained her ankle, daddy took children to a "park". This turned out to be
gardens, with a few small caves. Inside the caves were sculptures formed out of the art,
and also, there was evidently erosion and stalac[tite|mite]s coming from floor/ceiling
and into the sculptures. It gave an interesting feel to an ancient compound, with such
skill juxtapose to nature easily wearing away at man's effort.
